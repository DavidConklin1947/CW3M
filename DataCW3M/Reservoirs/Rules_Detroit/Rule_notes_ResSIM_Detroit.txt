2 - Conservation
	DET max power release - Max: Linear, var: pool_elev_current_value.   Applies only to power plant.
	Min Flow DET plus irrigation most years - Min, Linear, var:North Santiam Diversion, Current value (External variable)
           Description from Res-SIM - "Reads a variable called "Irrigation from Detroit", which is in file year_classification.dss, 
                                       which is just zeroes or ones. Places where no irrigation is added have a zero. These are all 
                                       Nov-March, and all year for deficit water years. Most years have a 1 in April through Oct. If 
                                       there is a one, then the rule adds 73 cfs to minimum outflow from Detroit.

Note:  Statement in the ResSIM model say the Lower RO is not ever used at Detroit.  True?
