Hill Creek specifics:
2 RO gates - max capacity - max capacity based on pool elevation and gate setting
2 spillway gates -  max capacity based on pool elevation and gate setting
Release allocation is sequential - 1st RO, 2nd Spillway


Notes:

Max_Flow_Winter_and_Conservation.csv: varies with both pool elevation and date.
    The file is set up with a marker in the first cell that this is dependent on 2 variables     (Date_pool_elev_m).  The rest of the first row contains dummy labels.  The 1st column contains 
    values for the date.  The 2nd row contains values for pool elevation.  Col 1, row 2 is set to
    -10 (a numeric value is required, but this row contains the pool elevation values).
