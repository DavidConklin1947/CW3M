Hills Creek specifics:
2 power plant gates - max capacity based on pool elev
2 RO gates - max capacity - max capacity based on pool elevation and gate setting
3 spillway gates -  max capacity based on pool elevation and gate setting
Tailwater elevation - 374m
Release allocation is sequential - 1st power plant - 2nd RO, 3rd Spillway
